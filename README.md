# CMS

A simple content management system (CMS) implemented using the Django framework lets users create and edit pages on a site dynamically through a web-based interface. This example is from the book "Practical Django Projects" by James Bennett (2008). Some adjustments were made to make it work with Python 3.10 and Django 5 (the book uses Python 2.5 and Django 0.96). This CMS integrates the TinyMCE Rich Text Editor (WYSIWYG or What You See Is What You Get) in the admin's create page template, allowing users to edit pages without knowing HTML and CSS.
