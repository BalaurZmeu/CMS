# CMS

A simple content management system (CMS) implemented using Django framework, which lets users create and edit pages on a site dynamically through a web-based interface. This example is from the book 'Practical Django Projects' by James Bennett (2008). Some adjustments were made to make it work with Python 3.10 and Django 5 (Python 2.5 and Django 0.96 are used in the book).
